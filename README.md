# Basic_Onshape_CAD
1. Base
Reflection: Doing the base was a good simple introduction to Onshape and its various capabilities, and a good CAD refresher. This assignment caused me to reflect more on the intersection of CAD and code, that both require logic and skill, as well as a knowledge of the program, in order to produce a product.
2. Mount
Reflection: Doing the mount taught me how to linear pattern in Onshape and to use all the features to my advantage in order to work smarter not harder. It still feels a little clunky using the program because my units are still not changed and I'm having issues with dimensioning, but I imagine that ease of use will come with time as I work in this program more and feel more confortable with all the shortcuts and features.
