1. Base
Reflection: Doing the base was a good simple introduction to Onshape and its various capabilities, and a good CAD refresher. This assignment caused me to reflect more on the intersection of CAD and code, that both require logic and skill, as well as a knowledge of the program, in order to produce a product.
2. Mount
Reflection: Doing the mount taught me how to linear pattern in Onshape and to use all the features to my advantage in order to work smarter not harder. It still feels a little clunky using the program because my units are still not changed and I'm having issues with dimensioning, but I imagine that ease of use will come with time as I work in this program more and feel more confortable with all the shortcuts and features. 
3. Fork
Reflection: This assignment was mostly helpful to me in just increasing my confidence and making the design process smoother as I got more comfortable with the program. It also helped me to appreciate both the aesthetic and the functionality of specific design choices. The fillets on the sides of the fork were more aesthetic, while the fillets at the bottom of those were to increase contact between the "prongs" of the fork and the circular base. 
4. Tire
Reflection: This assignment taught me to expand my ideas about how to produce the part that I have in mind. If I wasn't following instructions for this assignment, I probably would have chosed to revolve a circle. It certainly wouldn't have occurred to me to revolve a trapezoid and then fillet the edges. But having done this assignment I can see the benefits of using a trapezoid and then filleting in order to create a bit more traction on the tire. This causes me to think more about how I can acheive my design goals with less conventional routes that will produce better results. 
5. Wheel
Reflection: This assignment brought back memories of working on the caster assignment for the first time in 8th grade. I had such a hard time with the spokes, trying to get them even by dragging lines around. The method in this assignment is so much more fluid and effective than my attempts three years ago, and I can see how a bit of math can keep you organized and create clean and professional designs. 
6. Axle, Collar, and Bearings
Reflection: I thought it was so cool that I could create multiple objects within the same part studio and that Onshape would recognize that that's what it was and organize it for me. I'm just beginning to explore Onshape, but I love how they organize all the information and make it user-friendly. 
7. Sub-Assembly
Reflection: This sub-assembly presented a lot more challenges for me than the other assignments had because I am still getting used to Onshape's method of mating. I would say that this particular assignment was mainly a good practice with mates and a reminder that I need to be patient. :)
8. Assembly
Reflection: Seeing the culmination of the caster was exciting, realizing that I did it all on a chromebook in the cloud and with a trackpad. I love how Onshape opens up opportunities for more people to use CAD software without needed a big, expensive computer.
