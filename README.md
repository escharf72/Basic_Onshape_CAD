# Basic_Onshape_CAD
1. Base
Reflection: Doing the base was a good simple introduction to Onshape and its various capabilities, and a good CAD refresher. This assignment caused me to reflect more on the intersection of CAD and code, that both require logic and skill, as well as a knowledge of the program, in order to produce a product.
2. Mount
Reflection: Doing the mount taught me how to linear pattern in Onshape and to use all the features to my advantage in order to work smarter not harder. It still feels a little clunky using the program because my units are still not changed and I'm having issues with dimensioning, but I imagine that ease of use will come with time as I work in this program more and feel more confortable with all the shortcuts and features. 
3. Fork
Reflection: This assignment was mostly helpful to me in just increasing my confidence and making the design process smoother as I got more comfortable with the program. It also helped me to appreciate both the aesthetic and the functionality of specific design choices. The fillets on the sides of the fork were more aesthetic, while the fillets at the bottom of those were to increase contact between the "prongs" of the fork and the circular base.
