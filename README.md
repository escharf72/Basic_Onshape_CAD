**1. Base**

Reflection: Doing the base was a good simple introduction to Onshape and its various capabilities, and a good CAD refresher. This assignment caused me to reflect more on the intersection of CAD and code, that both require logic and skill, as well as a knowledge of the program, in order to produce a product.

**2. Mount** 

Reflection: Doing the mount taught me how to linear pattern in Onshape and to use all the features to my advantage in order to work smarter not harder. It still feels a little clunky using the program because my units are still not changed and I'm having issues with dimensioning, but I imagine that ease of use will come with time as I work in this program more and feel more confortable with all the shortcuts and features.

**3. Fork**

Reflection: This assignment was mostly helpful to me in just increasing my confidence and making the design process smoother as I got more comfortable with the program. It also helped me to appreciate both the aesthetic and the functionality of specific design choices. The fillets on the sides of the fork were more aesthetic, while the fillets at the bottom of those were to increase contact between the "prongs" of the fork and the circular base.

**4. Tire**

Reflection: This assignment taught me to expand my ideas about how to produce the part that I have in mind. If I wasn't following instructions for this assignment, I probably would have chosed to revolve a circle. It certainly wouldn't have occurred to me to revolve a trapezoid and then fillet the edges. But having done this assignment I can see the benefits of using a trapezoid and then filleting in order to create a bit more traction on the tire. This causes me to think more about how I can acheive my design goals with less conventional routes that will produce better results.

**5. Wheel**

Reflection: This assignment brought back memories of working on the caster assignment for the first time in 8th grade. I had such a hard time with the spokes, trying to get them even by dragging lines around. The method in this assignment is so much more fluid and effective than my attempts three years ago, and I can see how a bit of math can keep you organized and create clean and professional designs.

**6. Axle, Collar, and Bearings**

Reflection: I thought it was so cool that I could create multiple objects within the same part studio and that Onshape would recognize that that's what it was and organize it for me. I'm just beginning to explore Onshape, but I love how they organize all the information and make it user-friendly.

**7. Sub-Assembly**

Reflection: This sub-assembly presented a lot more challenges for me than the other assignments had because I am still getting used to Onshape's method of mating. I would say that this particular assignment was mainly a good practice with mates and a reminder that I need to be patient. :)

**8. Assembly**

Reflection: Seeing the culmination of the caster was exciting, realizing that I did it all on a chromebook in the cloud and with a trackpad. I love how Onshape opens up opportunities for more people to use CAD software without needed a big, expensive computer.

## Dorothy's Dowels (and picture frame) ##

https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/8363528224f20aa8a3c2da27/w/a840d1aa144c38fbb7f83636/e/104953e40e859db91250ae4e

**Description:** My task was to learn how to use configurations in Onshape by fulfilling a request from a "client" in the most efficient way. (Work smarter not harder.) The second part of the assignment was to use those dowels to construct a picture frame in Onshape. 

**Reflection:** I have been terrified of configurations ever since I did the gear assignment my freshman year. I didn't understand how they worked and felt that it was easier for me to work harder not smarter. *However*, having done this Onshape configurations assignment, I now understand how useful configurations can be and how simple they are once you get the logic. It was super simple to set them up and create the various configurations, and the hardest part was just figuring out which dimension/feature I needed to edit in order to acheive the desired results. The sides of the picture frame probed to be much more difficult than the dowels because I had to think about the geometry of the trapezoid shape and what dimension I could edit without skewing the proportions. 

**Results:** I am so much more confident with configurations now and hope to be able to use them in my projects later on.

## Onshape Challenge ## 
**Description:**
The challenge was to create a spinner mechanism with minimal instructions. 

**Reflection/Lessons Learned:**
This assignment helped me to be more confident in my Onshape skills and to improve my patience and perseverence. 
Mates were by far the most difficult thing for me in this assignment, but I was introduced to many of the mates as I tried to figure out which ones to use.
